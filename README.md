# Enhanced Order Data Integration in Business Central
developed a comprehensive AL procedure, GetOrderJson, to streamline and standardize the way order data is shared from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. This new function generates a detailed JSON representation of an order, including:

Customer details (contact info, loyalty, addresses)

Order lines (products, pricing, categories, brands)

Shipping information (method, carrier, tracking, addresses)

Order summary (status, totals, payment, discounts, tax)
